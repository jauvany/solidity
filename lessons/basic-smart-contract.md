To create a smart contract in Solidity, we will build a simple contract that demonstrates some common features. This contract will allow users to:

1. Store a value on the blockchain.
2. Retrieve the stored value.
3. Only allow the owner of the contract to update the value.

### Pseudocode
1. **Define Contract**:
   - Define a `SimpleStorage` contract.
2. **Declare Variables**:
   - `uint256` to store the value.
   - `address` to store the owner of the contract.
3. **Constructor**:
   - Set the `owner` to the address that deploys the contract.
4. **Modifiers**:
   - A `modifier` to restrict access to the owner.
5. **Functions**:
   - A `set` function to update the value (restricted to the owner).
   - A `get` function to retrieve the current value.

### Solidity Code

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    // State variables
    uint256 private storedData;
    address private owner;

    // Constructor to set the owner to the deployer of the contract
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Modifier to restrict access to owner
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    // Function to set a value (only owner can call this)
    function set(uint256 x) public onlyOwner {
        storedData = x;
    }

    // Function to get the stored value
    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

### Key Features:
- **Access Control**: Only the owner can set the value.
- **Data Storage**: The value is stored on the blockchain.
- **View Function**: Anyone can view the stored value.

This smart contract is a basic example and can be expanded with additional features such as events, more complex data structures, and interaction with other contracts.

I'd be glad to explain the provided Solidity code step by step:

**1. SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT**

* This line specifies the license under which the code is distributed. In this case, it's the MIT License, a permissive license that allows for modification and distribution of the code for any purpose, even commercial.

**2. pragma solidity ^0.8.0;**

* This line indicates the required Solidity compiler version. Here, it specifies version 0.8.0 or higher. Using a specific version ensures compatibility and avoids potential issues with outdated syntax or features.

**3. contract SimpleStorage {**

* This line declares a new Solidity contract named `SimpleStorage`. Contracts are essentially blueprints for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. They define the state variables, functions, and modifiers that govern their behavior.

**4. uint256 private storedData;**

* This line declares a state variable named `storedData` of type `uint256`. State variables are variables that are stored on the blockchain and persist between function calls. The `private` keyword restricts access to this variable within the contract itself.

**5. address private owner;**

* This line declares another state variable named `owner` of type `address`. An `address` represents a unique Ethereum account. The `private` keyword again restricts access to this variable within the contract.

**6. constructor() {**

* This line defines the constructor function, which is automatically called when the contract is deployed. Constructors are used to initialize the contract's state variables.

**7. owner = msg.sender;**

* Inside the constructor, this line assigns the `owner` state variable to the address of the person who deployed the contract (`msg.sender`). This effectively sets the deployer as the initial owner of the contract.

**8. modifier onlyOwner() {**

* This line defines a modifier named `onlyOwner`. Modifiers are a way to add additional logic to functions before they execute. In this case, the `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the contract's owner can call functions that use it.

**9. require(msg.sender == owner, "Caller is not the owner");**

* Inside the `onlyOwner` modifier, this line uses the `require` function to check if the caller's address (`msg.sender`) is equal to the `owner` state variable. If not, it reverts the transaction with the error message "Caller is not the owner".

**10. _;**

* This underscore symbol represents the body of the function that the modifier is applied to. It effectively means "execute the rest of the function".

**11. function set(uint256 x) public onlyOwner {**

* This line declares a public function named `set` that takes a `uint256` argument `x`. The `public` keyword makes this function accessible from outside the contract. The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the owner can call this function.

**12. storedData = x;**

* Inside the `set` function, this line assigns the value of `x` to the `storedData` state variable. This effectively sets the stored data within the contract.

**13. function get() public view returns (uint256) {**

* This line declares a public view function named `get` that returns a `uint256`. The `view` keyword indicates that this function does not modify the contract's state and can be called without spending gas.

**14. return storedData;**

* Inside the `get` function, this line returns the current value of the `storedData` state variable.
